<p>Because I work on Mac OS X system, I had no problem with choosing software to replace Photoshop CC with. I went for <a title="Affinity Photo" href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/photo/">Affinity Photo</a>, one of the most interesting programs for photographers, designed specifically for Macs. Affinity Photo offers all functions I need for convenient and effective work on my photographs, it is fast and reliable, has intuitive interface and last but not least, it comes in a standard license model without a monthly fee. Once I downloaded Affinity Photo from the Mac App Store, I watched some video tutorials made by Affinity team for new users. In few hours I’ve learned enough to start working on my photographs in new software and making necessary changes to optimise my workflow only took me a day or two. I haven’t regretted cancelling my Photoshop subscription ever since. It made me realise that using Photoshop is not the only choice available. Switching from Photoshop to Affinity Photo was easy and stress-free, and I benefited from using software with a little different approach than Adobe’s. It turns out you don’t always need Photoshop to do your job as a photographer and even if you want to perform advance photo post-processing, you are not limited to Creative Cloud subscription.</p>

<p><a href="https://leziak.com/images/Affinity-Photo-screenshot.jpg"><img src="https://leziak.com/images/Affinity-Photo-screenshot-768x443.jpg" alt="Affinity Photo interface" width="740" height="" /></a>
<em>Interface of Affinity Photo is intuitive and easy to navigate for both beginners and more experienced users.</em></p>

<p>In my academic research I use <a title="Scrivener by Literature and Latte" href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php">Scrivener</a> as my word processor of choice. It’s an excellent programme for professional writers of any kind, and despite the fact there is no better alternative on the market, it’s creators do not require you to pay constantly for using it in your text projects. You buy it once and use how long you want. Why purchasing photographic software needs to be any different? I don’t claim Adobe Photoshop is a bad programme. In fact it’s one of the best programmes I’ve ever used. But I do not accept Adobe’s subscription policy and I no longer want to <em>rent</em> my software on a monthly basis. I want to buy a license for my software and use it whenever I want, how long I want, without worrying about future changes in Creative Cloud subscription and the way Adobe Photoshop might or might not improve over its current state. If you work on a Mac and you need good software to edit your photos in it, I really recommend you trying Affinity Photo first, because it might turn out you don’t need Adobe Photoshop after all.</p>
