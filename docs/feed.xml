Here are my first impressions regarding that purchase. <!--more--></p>

<p>The initial configuration on the device itself was simple and straightforward. However, I have encountered problem when trying to set up a Postbox account, which is necessary to unlock the true potential of Traveler. There was simply… no option to create a new account on a Postbox main page! I had to switch to Springer, a website distraction-free interface, and only there, when I clicked on a status bar at the bottom of the screen, I was able to see an option to sign up to Postbox. It definitely was <strong>not</strong> an easy feat, and this is something that Astrohaus could definitely improve.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the rest of the configuration process was fast and easy. It took me about a minute to connect to my home Wi-Fi and log into Postbox. Not to mention that one can start writing on the device immediately after the booting up is complete. Postbox, while enhancing the functionality of Traveler, is absolutely not necessary to use it.</p>

<p>One of my biggest concerns before I got Traveler was the quality of its keyboard. Unlike the Smart Typewriter, Traveler lacks mechanical keyboard and uses scissor-switch keyboard, which is standard for middle and upper tier laptops. The keyboard is honestly not that bad. While it is not as good as a mechanical one (I use Keychron Q3 Pro as my daily driver), it is more comfortable than my MacBook Air, mostly due to fairy deep key travel, significantly improved over standard scissor-switch keys. Naturally, I cannot say how the keyboard performs in the long run just yet, but my first impressions are surprisingly positive. The only thing that could further improve Traveler’s keyboard (save for using low-profile mechanical switches, of course), is the option for purchasing a device equipped with ISO layout, which is pretty standard in Europe, yet practically unheard of in the USA. I got accustomed to an inverted L return key and I miss it a bit in Traveler. Yet I do understand why Astrohaus abandoned the idea of selling two versions of device with different keyboard layout after the second generation of Smart Typewriter (which one could purchase with ISO keys). It is simply cheaper to develop one version of hardware.</p>

<p>When it comes to an e-Ink screen, watching countless YouTube videos about Traveler I was afraid it would be too small for my liking (at least that is how it looked in many reviews). I was surprised to find it a perfect size for Traveler’s form factor. It gives me enough space to not feel claustrophobic and at the same time it does not distract me with too much of the previous text visible. One of the first things I changed in Traveler’s settings was font size, of which I picked the smallest. It makes approximately two paragraphs visible on the screen, which is absolutely enough to not get lost in the general flow of my thoughts. The clarity of the e-Ink display is superb. For someone who spends most of the time staring into backlighted displays, an e-Ink screen brings much needed rest for the eyes. As for the lack of front light that Smart Typewriter has, it turned out to be not as much of a hinderance as I expected. Because I always write while sitting at a desk or table of some sort, I can use the overhead light or a desk lamp. I have also bought a small book lamp with adjustable brightness, which works perfectly with Traveler.</p>

<p>I know that many people find the delay of the e-Ink screen distracting. I understand why it can be an issue, especially for touch typists. The delay between pressing a key and letter appearing on the screen is in the range of 0.5-0.7 second. For me it is perfectly acceptable, since I do not look at the screen when typing, and once I finish writing a sentence and look at the screen, it just about finishes updating. One should keep in mind that many people noticed increased lag as their documents are getting longer, so I will have to update my review once I reach that state. Still, I do not expect screen delay to be an issue for people who do not touch type.</p>

<p>The overall build quality is pretty good, although not perfect. My device has few rough edges where the white plastic meets the black one in the upper lid, and I have seen in few reviews that people have similar issues in other places. It is only noticeable when I look for it, though, and I do not care all that much. As a portable writing machine I expect to take Traveler in many places where it could get scratched or worse. I will let you know after a couple of weeks or months how it is holding up. One comestic thing that bothers me <em>just a little bit</em> is the way the label <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">new</code> is printed on two red keys at the bottom of the keyboard. I have noticed that already in a couple of other users’ photographs that the print on the red keys is a bit fuzzy and not as crisp as on the white ones. From up close I can confirm that this is true. The labels on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">new</code> keys seem to be printed in a different technique or with a different paint than the rest, which gives the text a bit more glossy, yet unsharp, look. Since I have only been using Traveler for an hour or so, I cannot comment on the durability of the labels, but again, I will get back to that topic after a longer period of using Traveler extensively.</p>

<p>One thing is certain, though: it <strong>does</strong> help one write faster. Without distractions of my computer or iPad I am 100% focused on <em>what</em> I am writing and <em>how</em> I am writing it. Because there is no web browser, no e-mail, no apps with notifications, nothing bothers me when I pour words onto digital paper. Interestingly, when I got some notification on my phone lying nearby I instinctively chose to ignore it, as if I knew at subconscious level that this is the time for writing and writing only. I did not extend such restraint when working in a text editor on a computer or tablet. It is still too early to say whether this positive effect will persist, and whether I will actually improve my productivity in the long run, but looking at how I enjoy this device, I am optimistic.</p>

<p>There are still many things I need to learn about Traveler, and the more I will use it the more refined my opinion will be. For now, I am happy about my purchase and I believe there are many joys of writing awaiting me.</p>]]></content><author><name>Kamil Leziak</name></author><category term="writing" /><category term="technology" /><category term="freewrite" /><category term="eink" /><category term="keyboard" /><category term="typewriting" /><category term="hardware" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I have bought a Freewrite Traveler, a portable distraction-free writing device with an e-Ink screen.

I have tried numerous solutions, both software (word processors, markdown editors, notepads) and hardware-related (keyboards in almost every shape and form). The more I looked for a perfect setup the more I doubted it had ever existed. Experimenting, however, brought me an immense joy, even if paired with a bit of frustration at times.<!--more--></p>

<p>I have always appreciated writing. It is a truly fascinating process, in which one can immortalise their thoughts, opinions and memories. I have learned more about myself by reading my old journals than through any other form of retrospection. But for me the act of writing is strongly affected by technical aspects and the smoothness of the overall experience. That is why I write a lot by hand, and use fountain pens on a daily basis. I care about the details of the process, as they can help me to immerse myself in the story I am telling without any external disruptions. That is why the quality of the writing workflow and specifics of the writing setup are so important to me.</p>

<p>For handwriting, I have already found the perfect solution<sup id="fnref:fn1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>: a combination of a comfortable fountain pen with an excellent nib, good quality ink and acid-free paper. My daily driver is <strong>Aurora Talentum GT</strong>, currently paired with <strong>Aurora 100th Year Special Edition Gray</strong> ink and <strong>Leuchtturm 1917</strong> notebook.</p>

<p>For typewriting, I have tried many solutions. It is relatively easy to find a good stationary setup. If one has no intention to move the hardware very often (or at all), a good mechanical keyboard with a high resolution monitor can be paired with a multitude of devices, from a regular PC, through a Mac, to a tablet or similar device. Having a dedicated space for a stationary setup means that one can invest in hardware that is optimised in terms of ergonomy and usability. An excellent solution would be a second, e-ink computer screen, used solely for writing, although they are hard to come by and pretty expensive (one of the best examples is <a href="https://onyxboox.com/boox_mira">Onyx Boox Mira</a>). I would love to use it as a dedicated computer screen for writing, yet I cannot justify such expense.</p>

<p>E-ink screens are superior to regular LCD or LED ones, due to lack of a backlight and eye strain that comes with it. They have also excellent readability in the sunlight, which may not be a top priority for a stationary setup, but is a huge factor for a mobile writing station. There have been a few projects trying to use the advantage of an e-ink screen in a portable writing device, with mixed results.</p>

<p>One of the most notable examples is the Freewrite Smart Typewriter, produced by Astrohaus. I <a href="../freewrite/">wrote about Freewrite back in 2016</a>, when the first generation was available for purchase. The device combines a mechanical keyboard with an e-ink screen and some basic sync functions in order to deliver a distraction-free typing experience. Currently Astrohaus sells the third generation of the Freewrite, which, while virtually identical to its predecessor in terms of visuals, offers certain software enhancements. The synchronisation feature is also more developed, allowing for wireless sharing of the draft to Google Drive, e-mail or Postbox (Astrohaus’ proprietary cloud service). I must admit that I was seriously considering buying the newest generation of the Freewrite Smart Typewriter (they also sell a portable device called Freewrite Traveler, but it lacks mechanical keyboard and the screen, while still e-ink, misses the built-in illumination).</p>

<p>There is a viable alternative for people looking for a mobile e-ink device suitable for writing: Remarkable 2. It is an e-ink tablet which allows for the creation of handwritten notes, offers handwriting OCR for many languages, PDF annotations and more. Some time ago a Remarkable Type Folio premiered, an external keyboard in a form of a folio cover. It allows one to use Remarkable as an e-ink typewriter. Although Remarkable Type Folio does not have a mechanical keyboard, it still offers a portable writing solution with an e-ink screen free of backlight-induced eye strain. It lacks illumination, just like Smartwrite Traveller, so is not usable in a dark without access to an external light source. Unfortunately, the Remarkable Type Folio supports only a handful of keyboard layouts, with the vast majority of European languages missing. It means that one cannot enter language-specific diacritics, which sadly is a deal-breaker for me. Although I write most of my essays in English, I want to retain the option to write in Polish if necessary.</p>

<p>This is almost as far as the e-ink options go, both Freewrite and Remarkable do not have competition in their respective categories<sup id="fnref:fn2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. It is a shame, thought, because I believe users could benefit greatly from innovation and price drop forced by competition in the market. Nevertheless, both devices serve a niche purpose, and there is not much demand for an e-ink typewriter or word processor in general. Most people are okay with starring at backlit LCD or OLED screens and are probably not even aware of benefits of the electronic paper.</p>

<p>My current option for writing on the go is an 11-inch iPad Pro with Paperlike screen protector and Logitech Folio Touch. It does not offer full benefits of an e-ink screen, but it does reduce glare and resultant eye-strain. I have been a fan of writing on iPad from the beginning. I used the original Smart Keyboard Folio for 2018 iPad Pro, but sadly the quality of that thing was abysmal. I had Smart Keyboard Folio break down on me after a year and a half, and its replacement followed the same course. After that I decided to make an exception and <em>not</em> buy Apple’s Magic Keyboard for the new 2020 iPad Pro, mostly because I was still wary of all the issues with their folio keyboard. Plus, the price of that accessory, even for the 11-inch model, was eye-watering (in fact, it still is). Since my iPad Pro from 2020 does not support some new functions like Stage Manager on external display, I decided to keep it for as long as possible, and only buy Magic Keyboard for the new model, once I decide it is time to upgrade. And since the current model has been working like a charm for four years now, it might not happen anytime soon.</p>

<p>I am thinking about experimenting with an external mechanical keyboard connected to an e-ink tablet working on Android, or to a Raspberry Pi connected to an e-ink display. The first solution would be trivially easy to implement, but also quite expensive (e-ink tablets, especially ones with a colour screen, still cost a lot), while the second one would allow me to save some money but for the price of time taken to make everything work well together. For now, I continue to use my iPad Pro, hoping that one day I will find that elusive perfect writing setup.</p>

      <p>It should be noted, naturally, that what is the perfect solution for <em>me</em> may not necessarily be the perfect solution for anyone else.

While Instagram inarguably has the largest user base, it also has serious privacy issues, as it (or actually Meta, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook) collects tremendous amount of data about its users, their devices, location, habits, interests and multitude of other things. All this for a single purpose: to serve users the most effective ads possible.</p>

<p>I abhor Meta’s dubious ethics, therefore I was looking for Instagram alternative. I’ve tried various services, of which <a href="https://www.vsco.co">VSCO</a> briefly captured my attention. Ultimately I was discouraged by the recurring subscription cost and the fact that it felt very hermetic and monotonous. With the increased popularity of federated social media I started to publish photographs on my <a href="https://mastodon.social/@vertiser">Mastodon</a> first<sup id="fnref:fn1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, but it didn’t feel like an optimal solution. I considered creating a separated account in federated social media specialised in sharing photographs, namely Pixelfed. That thought stayed with me for a couple of months, but only at the end of July I finally took the step to create an account and upload my first photographs.</p>

<p>The whole experience has been positive so far and I intend to keep my Pixelfed profile. As for its content, it will be similar to VSCO and, previously, Instagram: casual, everyday photographs, occasionally mixed with some travel shots. If you are looking for some thematically consistent series of fine art photographs, feel free to check out the <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/vertiser/gallery/71989994/photographs">Photography gallery on my deviantART profile</a>. DeviantART is still the main place where I publish more sophisticated works.</p>

Thanks to spontaneous purchases, Steam Summer Sales, Black Friday offers, etc. we tend to accumulate more and more games at attractive prices. ‘It was a bargain, and I wanted to play this game anyway’ one may justify their purchase to themselves (<em>I</em> do quite often, actually). In the end many of those games never see the proverbial light of day, and they stay on shelves of our digital libraries, collecting virtual dust. <!--more--></p>

<p>During my decades of gaming I realised that, most of the time, I prefer to replay known titles rather than to try out something new. I have certain favourites that have a permanent place in my heart, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_(video_game)">Gothic</a>, Skyrim, The Witcher series, and I like to get back to them whenever I can. But the problem arising from this attitude is, I rarely try something new. Buying Nintendo Switch in 2019 has partially alleviated the issue, allowing me to try many new games, especially when travelling. But it has not solved the problem with many titles staying in my library, never even installed, or only opened briefly for a couple of minutes. At some point I decided to change that, so I created the <a href="../all-games/">All Games</a> project.</p>

<p><strong><a href="../all-games/">The All Games</a> project is my attempt at playing every single game I have in my gaming library (or <em>all</em> my gaming libraries, to be precise).</strong> I have an intention to play every game on my many accounts: Steam, GOG, Origin, as well as standalone games I bought digitally or physically over the years. The goal is, to actually experience all the games I own. So I do not want to only open them, finish the first chapter, mission or quest and be done with it, but get involved with the core aspect of each game. This rule does not specify that I must have a 100% completion of all games<sup id="fnref:fn1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, nor that I need to get all of the game’s achievements/trophies on a respective platform. I do not need to finish the main storyline or quest, but I must engage in each game. For certain games I may add my own goals or achievements that I want to get. Once I obtain them all, I will consider game fully completed from my point of view.</p>

<p>Should I inevitably buy some new games along the way, they will be added to the goal; they will affect the progression and count towards the total number of games to play. Both the list of the games and the progression will be updated regularly. Naturally, games that I had already played and completed will be included in the list. I have no incentive to do things that I do not like in my free time, so if there is a game that displeasures me, I will abandon it at certain point, but not before making several attempts to discover some likeable aspects.</p>

<p>There is no specific timeframe or a deadline for the whole endeavour. I treat it as an ongoing personal project, a way of making sure I fully utilise the entertainment potential of games I already own. <a href="../all-games/">The progress page</a> will be updated regularly, to reflect the current status of the project.</p>

On the first of January 2023 I permanently deleted my Twitter account and now I let go of Reddit as well. Both decisions are rooted in a similar issue: questionable ethics and actions of the respective CEO. <!--more-->I do not believe an explanation is in order for me leaving Twitter. Elon Musk’s irresponsible and erratic behaviour has been widely described and discussed on the web. But what about Reddit?</p>

<p>Two months ago Reddit <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/">announced changes in the access to their API</a>, an action that bears dire consequences for the third party apps many people used to browse Reddit, like Apollo for iOS or RIF for Android. To cut the long story short: third party apps will have been basically forced to shutdown by the end of June due to gargantuan costs of use of Reddit API starting in July. There is a <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/apollo_will_close_down_on_june_30th_reddits/">detailed explanation of the situation</a> posted by Christian Selig, the developer of Apollo and I encourage you to dig deeper into the conversation, to uncover the whole picture of Reddit malevolence.</p>

<p>The main issue that arises both from Twitter and Reddit examples is, the social media as we know them became so goal-oriented that they lost the big picture in the process. The goal, in virtually all cases of commercial/centralised social media is simply to multiply the revenue <em>in perpetuo</em>. And anyone who has even rudimentary knowledge of how the world is working knows that it cannot happen. Profit cannot rise exponentially, even if that’s what investors or owners would expect. And looking for a way to further maximise profit, to monetise the hell out of a social media website and its users can have dreadful consequences. We know what happened to Twitter, and now similar thing is happening to Reddit. Somehow Reddit CEO<sup id="fnref:fn1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> believed that he had a right to own the users, their content and their work, and monetise on that while at the same time taking away their choice of Reddit clients that offered superior experience to both Reddit website and the first party app. Mass protest in the form of many subreddits going dark (i.e. restricting posting or visibility) arose on the 12th of June and lasted for 48 hours, however Reddit admins started to do a whole set of unethical things, including threatening moderators of subreddits that were still protesting after the 14th that they would be removed and a new moderation team would be installed in their place, manually changing subreddits restrictions against the will of the moderators or users, removing or suspending moderation teams and so on. It should be noted that all those actions were approved (or even sanctioned) by the CEO, whose main goal is apparently to show everyone that he is right (despite the fact he really isn’t), even if it’s destroying Reddit in the process.</p>

<p>I have no doubts that once the dust settle there will still be plenty of users on the platform, and most of the top subreddits will have new, pro-Reddit moderation teams. But the Reddit we know is already lost. Many people have already left or will leave Reddit in the very near future, and, what apparently is not yet obvious to the sorry excuse of a CEO, those would be people who actually were <em>creating</em> content on Reddit, people who added value to the website. Because without the creators, the moderators, the people who care about their communities, Reddit is only a shell. And pretty useless one, at that.</p>

<p>A few days before the going dark protests I have already scrambled and removed all my content on Reddit, including posts, comments, conversations. Two days later I have made a <a href="https://gdpr.eu/data-privacy/">GDPR request</a> under Article 15 to obtain all my data and check whether Reddit has truly removed all the informations I ordered them to. Once I confirm there is no content authored by me left on their platform, I’m permanently deleting my account <strong>[Update: I have already done it]</strong>. I have already removed it from the Social media links sections on the <a href="../about/">About</a> page. If you want to delete your Reddit account as well, I strongly recommend you delete your content first, as to not give Reddit anything to monetise from for free. Normally even if you delete your account all your content (posts, comments, etc.) are still there, only with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[deleted]</code> placeholder instead of your actual username. That is why it is important to use a tool like <a href="https://redact.dev">Redact</a> first, to overwrite and then delete your content before deleting the account itself.</p>

<p>I’m leaving Reddit without regrets. There is no way I would support an unethical conduct or enable an evil person to hurt online communities by adding one more user to the head count. I hope that Reddit will crash and burn, and people find an alternative that would be more user-friendly. Federated social networks come to mind here, as their fundamental characteristics of being decentralised yet federated make them immune to egregious acts of a single bad actor like Reddit’s CEO. If you are looking for a Reddit replacement, options in the federated social networks include <a href="https://kbin.social">kbin.social</a>, <a href="https://join-lemmy.org">lemmy</a> and many other projects. You can also check <a href="https://sub.rehab">alternatives for specific subreddits</a> to find an optimal place to continue your discussion and engagement in certain communities. That is the beauty of open internet: one or even many evil people cannot monopolise your experience, nor force you to use their social media platforms. People will always seek safe and free alternatives. Just remember to be mindful and tread carefully as you discover new places on the internet. Not all communities, websites or servers have the same rules regarding privacy, handling of your data, etc. But this is something we all should have learned by this point.</p>

<p>Whatever your post-Reddit journey will be, I wish you good luck.</p>

<p>Internet in general, and World Wide Web in particular, is a one-of-a-kind place accumulating tremendous amount of knowledge. Ever since the WWW was conceived in 1991<sup id="fnref:fn1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> it has helped millions of people to share various pieces of information, from favourite pasta recipes to books reviews. If not for the web, we would not be in the place we are now, both socially and technologically.</p>

<p>90’s and 00’s were, in my opinion, the golden age of the Internet. People were discovering what the Internet was all about. It was an uncharted territory and everyone of us felt like an explorer in the middle of an unknown jungle. There were plenty of treasures to discover, but it often depended on one’s abilities to look for the right thing in the right place (that’s also why in the early days it was called “surfing the internet”, not simply “browsing”). Web catalogues were popular, grouping pages in thematic categories (i.e. “sports”, “motorisation”, “cooking”, “gardening” and so on). Search engines were not a thing yet. You could not simply type your keyword, press Enter and get results a second later. It was more like looking through a phonebook (although I’m aware that this comparison might be lost anyway for the younger generation). Websites were not added to catalogues automatically. For each catalogue one wanted their website to be added to, they had to undergo the process manually, by either filling a form or contacting the webmaster. And there were <em>a lot</em> of catalogues to choose from.</p>

<p>The websites themselves were not perfect, by any standard, simply because there were hardly any standards to adhere to. Everyone tried to make their website look pretty, and for some it meant adding sparking GIFs as the background, for other it was bars with coloured moving text, for others — clip arts, etc. Digital cameras were not as popular, so photographs were not omnipresent, and videos were virtually nonexistent till the mid-00’s, mostly because many people still used dial-up connections, which had very limited speed (and by saying “limited” I really mean that: 56 <em>kilobits per second</em> was the maximum speed of a standard dial-up connection, which correspond to a total bandwidth of <em>8 KB per second</em> (upload and download combined).</p>

<p>Still, despite the obvious shortcomings, the early web (sometimes also called “the web 1.0”) was inherently <em>personal</em>. People shared their thoughts, knowledge and opinions not only through their personal websites, but also on various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum">internet forums</a> and, in certain cases, even beyond the web itself (e.g. via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet_newsgroup">newsgroups</a>, which used usenet protocol). While every internet forum was an independent entity, the whole community of the early Internet shared similar attitude. It was a social place and a sharing place. Forums were ran by private individuals, whose goal was not to monetise or track the users to sell their data, but to simply maintain a discussion in a semi-public space. Informations posted on forums, newsgroups or personal websites were widely available to almost everyone. Even if a given forum had privacy settings requesting guests to log in in order to view discussions or download attachments, etc., it was usually only a brief obstacle, as anyone was free to register and to make use of the knowledge and informations provided. And those informations remained unobstructed, easy to search for, easy to use. It was even easier with personal websites, since they didn’t require any registration at all in order to access their content, making the knowledge posted there available. And the knowledge available was sometimes so specific or niche, it was unobtainable in any other way.</p>

<p>I still remember one time when I contacted the owner of a website devoted to hamsters, because I had one that seemed to be allergic to regular food and the vet I went to was unable to help me due to their lack of experience with small pets. That website owner had published an incredibly detailed article on what and when she was giving to her hamsters in order to keep them in good health and prevent allergies. Keep in mind it was 2001, and one could not simply find such informations easily. After I contacted her she gave me some helpful tips on what to do and thanks to that I was able to make my hamster healthy and happy again. I would have not been able to do that, had the access to that website been restricted somehow.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we are long past that point in the history of the web and Internet. The rise of giants like Google and, later, Facebook has forever changed the shape of the Internet. Now private, personal websites are few and far between, and the vast majority of informations is being shared via social media. Instead of private, people-oriented internet forums we have Facebook groups, instead of personal websites and blogs we have tweets, status updates and shorts. This causes a multitude of problems, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>walled garden: content being only accessible by people registered to the given social network (e.g. Instagram forcing people to log in in order to view public profiles)</li>
  <li>content already accepted being subject to later removal/alteration/censorship due to a shift in company policy (e.g. Tumblr NSFW content ban)</li>
  <li>users being tracked while browsing content on a platform (basically <em>any</em> social media right now)</li>
  <li>unexpected restrictions of various type due to changes of the ownership/policy/goals (i.e. Elon Musk blocking Twitter users from linking to other social media)</li>
  <li>content not being available on older hardware or software, or via privacy modes restricting ad targeting or user profiling</li>
</ul>

<p>These problems are merely the tip of an iceberg. The whole shift towards social media as the primary space for sharing, well, basically <em>anything</em>, caused a great websites extinction. Long gone are private websites where the owner shared precious knowledge on a niche subject, there is hardly anything left of internet forums where people passionately discussed miscellaneous topics. Usenet groups are totally obsolete now. Many of my web bookmarks saved 10, 15 years ago are dead now, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot">link rot</a> is spreading and may be even a bigger problem in the future. Although we live in an age of information, we are losing incredible amount of data. Some of the websites of the old Internet have been <a href="https://web.archive.org">archived</a> in a bare-bones form, but it does not preserve how the website looked like when it was alive. It can give us a glimpse of a lost past, but nothing more.</p>

<p>Naturally, there are many reasons for why certain websites or articles are no longer available. Some of them have been hosted under a free subdomain, and the service providing free subdomains has ceased operation. Some were located on personal computers that acted as servers, and were lost when the computer was no longer online, perhaps too old, too loud, too power hungry. Some were removed when the owner did not pay for their hosting on commercial servers. Some people have inevitably lost interest in maintaining their website or being an admin of an internet forum. Many simply passed away, and their websites eventually succumbed to lack of maintenance or failed payment for another hosting/domain renewal period. Whatever the reason, it all ultimately leads to the loss of information. We loose knowledge from people who can no longer share it, we loose stories from people that cannot tell them anymore. We loose many precious things before we even realise how precious they were. This is why the persistence of information is so important.</p>

<p>We cannot afford to loose information. The knowledge published online should be preserved whenever it is possible. What has been lost cannot be recovered, but we may take action to make sure that the current state of the web knowledge in its general meaning is preserved. First and foremost, <strong>own your words!</strong> This catchphrase simply means that one should primarily post their content, regardless of its type (articles, photos, drawings, etc.) on their own website. Whenever you upload your work of art, that art being old Grandma’s recipe, a National Geographic-worthy photograph or review of a book you read, upload it to the part of the web that belongs to you. If you post your content on Twitter, or Facebook, or Tumblr, or any other website, it is subject to the website’s terms of service, and can be deleted or banned on a whim. If the website goes down for any reason, all your stuff goes down with it. If you decide to leave that social network (like during the Twitter exodus last November), you leave your content behind. Of course you can re-publish it in a new place, but people who had the link to your original post won’t be redirected to the new place. By sharing your content, knowledge and information on your own website you retain full control. You can change servers and hosting providers as many times as you want; as long as you keep your domain up, the URL will always be the same. I, myself, have changed hosting providers five times since 2015, while this website still remained operational.</p>

<p>There is a concept that describes this premise in a greater detail, called <a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE">POSSE</a> — Publish [on your] Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere. While keeping information on one own’s website does not eliminate the risk of deletion due to abandoning the project, or one’s untimely demise, it makes that knowledge more accessible to people on the Internet. I know that one could argue that social media have much further reach than a personal website, but the whole affair is not about the reach, views or impressions. It is about <em>persistence</em>. I believe that owning your own words is a key to information persistence on the Internet.</p>

It is a short but interesting game about life, happiness and discovering your true self. <!--more--> The game presents the story of Florence Yeoh, a woman in her mid-twenties, who follows her daily routine and works in an office job. The job, as well as her whole life, is monotonous and does not make her happy. However, one day when walking down the street she hears a street performer playing a cello. She decides to listen to his music, and that’s how she meets Krish.</p>

<p>The rest of the game depicts their dates and relationship. While the story is linear (one can only follow a planned path, and there are no decisions that change the final outcome), Florence feels very refreshing in a way. The player slowly discovers Florence’s relationship with Krish, from the initial honeymoon phase to the first fight and later conflicts. Most of one’s actions comes in a form of various mini games, and completing puzzles moves the story forward. I was playing Florence on Nintendo Switch and mini games utilised console’s controls in a proper way, although sometimes were a tiny bit annoying (i.e. when one had to be fairly precise while solving a jigsaw puzzle).</p>

<p>Florence is a short game — it took me about an hour to complete, although I was not in a hurry. One could probably finish the whole story in about twenty minutes, although I do not recommend that approach. The pleasure of Florence comes from exploring the game and its story, and rushing it would ruin the experience. I played Florence on Nintendo Switch and it looks like a perfect game to play on the go. It is beautifully immersive and makes morning commute go faster. Unfortunately it does not have big replay value, since the plot, mini games and ending are always the same. I wish developers had thought about adding some new content or ending unlocked once a player finishes the game for the first time.</p>

<p>Speaking of the ending, the final message of the game is bittersweet, although optimistic. I personally believe Florence would have benefited from a different approach. Nevertheless, I understand why developers chose what they did.</p>

It was nothing like this for me. <!--more--> I cannot recall a single defining moment that sparked my interest in aviation. I think it was more gradual, growing slowly without me noticing.</p>

<p>While I was not an aviation geek, I have always liked to watch some documentaries about airplanes, although there was no particular reason that I can pinpoint. Maybe it was because of the technology involved? Or physics of flight? Or just the awesomeness of aerial view? I have no idea. I only know that I had been watching Air Crash Investigation on National Geographic Channel for a few years and I found that series really… interesting (I don’t think that “entertaining” would be the right world, especially in the context of what was shown in the programme, but I truly liked watching new episodes and discovering reasons for failures that were reenacted).</p>

<p>I remember that at the end of 2017 I had a lot of free time. I was staying home alone after Christmas, till the 2nd or 3rd of January, since the rest of my family travelled to another city for a family meeting. I was a designated house-sitter, so I had to look after our house and a family dog. It was a nice although not necessary exciting time. I was spending evenings watching Marvel movies (basically did an Avengers marathon), I read some books, watched YouTube, but soon I found myself a bit bored. I decided, rather spontaneously, to check out some flight simulators for PC. Keep in mind that I was not familiar with the subject and knew nothing about the software or hardware required. I found a relatively cheap joystick and throttle set<sup id="fnref:fn1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> on Amazon, that I ordered with express delivery, and after a short web search I found X-Plane 10 and bought its license.</p>

<p>Two days later the joystick and throttle set arrived, and after a brief configuration I opened X-Plane 10 to begin my first flight. I remember that once I launched X-Plane I was surprised that there was no such thing as “new mission” or “play” button, etc. I was a newbie back then, and I didn’t know yet that flight simulation is not a game and it would be rather depreciating to treat it as such. To be fair, I still don’t consider flight sim a game. It is a sort of entertainment, that’s for sure, but for me there is a distinctive difference between playing e.g. Skyrim or Minecraft, or GTA, and flight simulation. I suppose it is because, while in ordinary games I can do whatever I want, regardless of how real my actions are, in flight simulation it is much more enjoyable for me to try and imitate the realism of actual flight than to do some wild acrobatics that would probably end in a crash and a virtual crater on the ground (although there <em>were</em> many unintended crashes at the beginning of my flight sim journey; I was learning how to fly by trials and errors…).</p>

<p>It was an exhilarating experience, to perform the first successful flight in a flight simulator. I remember that I was proud of myself, even though my landing was probably rather hard (I didn’t have a landing rate plugin back then, so we’ll never know—maybe it’s for the best?). The experience of virtual flight had another important impact on me: it made me want to learn more about the topic. I was consuming huge numbers of articles, posts on web forums, YouTube videos, to learn everything: how to handle the aircraft, what are correct ways of navigating, how to fly safely and effectively. I read the whole manual for X-Plane twice.</p>

<p>I think that within a month or two I dived into another big subject, that is the social aspect of flying virtually. I learned about VATSIM and online flight certification, I also discovered virtual airlines and how great it was to be a member of a community. Before I realised, I have been flying regularly, thoroughly enjoying the experience. I started flying with a virtual airline, first it was <a href="http://www.alliance-airways.net">Alliance Airways</a>, an airline specifically focused on X-Plane. I enjoyed my time there, but at some point I decided to broaden my horizons, and I became a member of <a href="https://flyvirtual.net">Fly Virtual</a>. I’ve been flying with them ever since.</p>

<p>From the very beginning of my experience my simulator of choice was X-Plane. The key factor that determined me buying it in the first place was good physics of flight, better than in FSX, according to some fellow flight simmers. I did my first flight on X-Plane 10, but not long after version 11 was released, and my license key was good for both versions, so I made the switch. In January this year I bought X-Plane 12, although I still use version 11 on a regular basis, simply because all my add-ons and paid aircraft are there, and I haven’t got enough motivation to go through the trouble of checking which of my add-ons are compatible just yet.</p>

<p>Naturally, my adventure with flight simulation is not over. I still have a lot to learn, and there are many, many things on my to-do list, both in terms of routes and aircraft to check out, as well as improving my skills and learning something new. As long as flight simulation continues to bring me joy, I will be spending some time in the virtual skies.</p>

While keeping a resolution throughout the year may be a challenge, there are some ways in which one may increase their chance of success. I would like to share with you some advices on how to keep a resolution to write on each day of the year. <!--more--></p>

<h2 id="decide-what-you-will-be-writing-about">Decide what you will be writing about</h2>
<p>The most important part of planning your resolution is deciding on what you are going to write about. Are you a fiction writer that wants to create a new novel? Do you like journaling and want to write down your thoughts on every day? Are you interested in writing articles on a topic you find enjoyable? To properly outline your goal you should be aware of what you <em>want</em> to write about. To make a writing resolution work you should try to write about things that are genuinely interesting to you, or bring you joy, or that you want to share your thoughts on. Forcing yourself to work on a text that you find boring won’t lead you anywhere.</p>

<p>It does not mean that you need to pick only one topic, or only one scheme of writing for your daily resolution. I believe you will have higher chances of success when alternating between different forms, i.e. a journal, blog posts, some fiction. Giving some thoughts to what type of output you want to create will help you a lot down the road, because it will allow you to plan and organise your actions accordingly. If you want to write a blog, you can make a decision to write a post per day, or maybe to write a new post every other day, so you can work on a single entry for two days, etc. In a resolution to write daily it is not important to <em>finish</em> a new piece of writing every day, but to <em>write</em> something every day.</p>

<h2 id="set-a-measurable-daily-goal-for-writing">Set a measurable daily goal for writing</h2>
<p>Once you know what you will be writing about, or what kind of texts you want to produce, you should focus on determining the specifics of your daily goal for writing. It may be counterintuitive for you, as in the last paragraph I explicitly mentioned that the resolution is simply about writing something each day. But it would be a great help in keeping your resolution to define a measurable goal for daily writing. Some clear requirement that will be easy to recognise when fulfilled each day. A few examples are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>writing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> number of words each day</li>
  <li>writing for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> number of minutes each day</li>
  <li>writing once a day, after breakfast</li>
  <li>naming one good thing that happened today</li>
  <li>writing at least one paragraph of your newest story</li>
</ul>

<p>Having a measurable goal will help you by giving an additional confidence boost when fulfilling it each day. The whole concept is based on achieving bigger goals in smaller increments. Virtually no one would be able to write a complete book in one sitting, but doing that step by step is absolutely possible.</p>

<p>It is up to you whether you would like to define a daily writing goal or just stay at “simply writing something every day”. What works for one person may not necessary work for another. However, if you decide to introduce a daily goal, my advice to you is to keep it:</p>
<ol>
  <li>simple</li>
  <li>achievable</li>
</ol>

<p>Simple means that the goal should be easy to remember and to validate. It is easier to manage a goal like <em>write 300 words each day</em> than <em>write three new chapters of the story each week, with at least 300 words on workdays and 550 words on weekends, half of which should be a dialogue</em>. The simpler the goal the better it will work. As for achievable, <strong>daily goal only makes sense when you can actually make it in everyday situations.</strong> Therefore it should be tailored to your needs, taking into account resources that you have available (free time being the most critical resource for majority of people). If you set yourself a goal that is too ambitious, after repeated failures it will only discourage you from keeping your writing resolution. If on average you write 400-500 words in one sitting, do not set yourself a goal to write 1500 words each day. You won’t make it on all days, which will frustrate and discourage you. Instead make a goal of writing at least 300 words each day, which would be <em>below</em> your average words output in this example.</p>

<h2 id="track-your-progress">Track your progress</h2>
<p>The best chance of keeping your resolution and writing something every day of the year is to keep track of the progress you have made so far, and to use the power of streaks to motivate you even further. You can mark days in calendar when you were able to write anything or those when you met your daily writing goal. If you prefer digital solutions, there are dozens of applications that will help you with that. But remember not to push yourself too much. There may be days when you will be sick, or tired, or travelling, when it just won’t be possible for you to write. It is okay to have a day or two out of the streak if your body or mind needs it. We are not machines after all.</p>

<p><strong>It is not a break in a streak that endangers our efforts. It is not returning to the routine afterwards.</strong> This is why you should always get back to your resolution as soon as possible, once the reason for your break had passed. It doesn’t matter if you lost two or five, or ten days, as long as you get back on track afterwards, everything is fine.</p>

<h2 id="find-the-motivation-inside-you">Find the motivation inside you</h2>
<p>New Year’s resolutions can be difficult to maintain in the long run. Not because they are impossible to keep, but because as the year progresses, there is less of the festive atmosphere and energy left in us, and more and more of mundane reality and responsibilities. It is getting harder to do things with the same level of excitement we had at the beginning of January. We need to keep and protect our motivation, for in many cases motivation is the main drive for changes and improvement, as well as for keeping our resolutions. There are different kinds of motivation, but the one important to us is the internal motivation. It is the strongest one, although fairly difficult to control. It can start fading if we don’t take care of it. What can help is remembering the reasons why you decided to make that resolution in the first place. What did you want to change? What did you want to accomplish? Perhaps you wanted to grow as a person. Or publish your first book. Or improve your writing style. Or impress your friend. There could have been many reasons why you decided to start a new year with a resolution to write more, but remembering those reasons will help you significantly. You can write down all the reasons why you made the resolution and look at that list every time you feel like your motivation is dwindling.</p>

<h2 id="perseverance-is-everything">Perseverance is everything</h2>
<p>There will be time when you are tired or angry, or annoyed, and the last thing you want to do is to write something because of a resolution you made a few months ago. In times when motivation fails and everything seems to align against you, perseverance is everything. Keep going even if you do not want to. Just do one small step at a time. And then another. And one more. Motivation can only get you so far. Perseverance and discipline can help you in key moments.</p>

<p>It is not possible to mention every single tip on keeping a resolution in writing, after all everyone is different and prefers different approaches to routines. I still hope that you found my advices useful, though.</p>]]></content><author><name>Kamil Leziak</name></author><category term="writing" /><category term="resolution" /><category term="newyear" /><category term="tips&amp;tricks" /><category term="howto" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The beginning of a new year is perfect moment to start a new resolution.

There is a tiny bit of magic in the air, a spark of hope and dreams that tries to carry us into the new year. <!--more-->It stands in a stark contrast to the mundane everyday routine that consumes us through the majority of the year. But December is different, and time before Christmas can be special in its own way.</p>

<p>When I was a kid I loved Christmas, and Winter holidays in general. Christmas Eve, celebrations, gifts under the Christmas tree, those were some highlights of the season that made it such an unforgettable experience for a child. I was truly fortunate, for my parents did everything they could to make Christmas a unique time for their children. We were enjoying our company, visiting relatives, going to church, listening to carols.</p>

<p>As Christmas was the culmination of the holidays, it wasn’t until many years later that I realised that my most fond memories are not of Christmas Eve or Christmas Day itself, but of the time before Christmas and all those little moments that led to it. I remember that a week or two before Christmas my father went to the attic and came down with a box of Christmas lights. We had probably around half a dozen sets accumulated through many years. Those were the ordinary lights with mini lightbulbs, not the modern LED sets, so my father and I had to check every set for burnt out lightbulbs, snapped cables (they were thin and broke easily), broken plugs. He had a special box in which he kept spare lightbulbs in various shape and size (in four colours that every set came in — red, yellow, green and blue), electrical tape, scissors, etc. It usually took us a couple of Winter evening to make all necessary repairs, with the light sets unraveled on the floor and us threading carefully between them, trying not to crush any lightbulbs, or tangle ourselves in the cables.</p>

<p>Some lights sets were quite old, I remember one that had those tiny gas bulbs shaped like a candle’s flame, giving a beautiful orange glow, with a minuscule gas arc flickering inside. The sockets were shaped like wax candles, with lightbulbs being mounted in the place of a flame. One or two candles’ plastic covers partially melted due to electric surge years ago, so my father had to repair them himself since spare parts were not available back then. I think that it might still be there, forgotten in a dusty box somewhere. It does not matter, though.</p>

<p>What matters, is a memory. It has been over twenty years and I still consider those lights-repairing evenings as one of the best, if not the best, Christmas experience. I am sure that you too could choose a particularly vivid memory related to Christmas that brings you nostalgia. Our minds are great at two things: gathering a lot of memories and hiding them from our view. For the most of the year we pay little attention to some distant memories or dreams we had before the adulthood. Contemporary world is uncannily good at overloading us with superficial stimuli, which can prevent us from thinking too much about days gone. But the past is there, and there are times, like Christmas, when it is easier for it to resurface.</p>

<p>The older I am the more I value memories from my childhood, or even from my teenage years. They have huge sentimental value, but they also allow me to see how I have changed throughout the years. Sometimes I can use this retrospection to get myself “back on track”, if I see that I gave up a hobby that I used to love (like astronomy, for example) or I am not focused on my long-term goals like I should be, etc. However, even simple action of enjoying one’s memories and nostalgic feeling that comes with it can be a pleasure in its own right (perhaps a bittersweet one, but a pleasure nonetheless). And one positive thing that comes with Christmas is that this time of year encourages us to look into our past a little bit more than usual.</p>

<p>May we put those memories to good use.</p>]]></content><author><name>Kamil Leziak</name></author><category term="misc" /><category term="personal" /><category term="christmas" /><category term="memories" /><category term="nostalgia" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This time of year is always special.
