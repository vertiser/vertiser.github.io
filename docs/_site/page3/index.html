            Moving from Photoshop to Affinity Photo
          </a>
        </h3><p>I’ve recently made one of the biggest changes in my workflow as a photographer: I’ve switched from Adobe Photoshop CC to Affinity Photo software for post-processing and retouching my images. This change was not easy to make. I’ve been using Photoshop in a professional way for several years now, I’ve become familiar with its possibilities and the way its functions work. However, I’m unsatisfied with the way Adobe Photoshop develops: each new iteration brings less innovations and improvements, at least in the field in which I’m using this software. Also, I’m a big opponent of subscription-based applications. While it might be an optimal solution for one to pay low monthly fee for a software he/she uses, sooner or later one reaches the point when accumulated cost of the subscription is higher than the retail price of a stand-alone software license. I reached that point and wondered: “Do I really need to pay monthly for Photoshop, while there are other solutions just as functional?” None of Photoshop updates in the last two years have been really useful for me, tools and modules I use work in the same way and as effective as they used to few years ago. Therefore I made a decision: it’s time for a change. Let’s try something new, let’s find some Photoshop replacement.</p>

            Freewrite - an ultimate solution for writers?
          </a>
        </h3><p>Few days ago I accidentally found out that one of Kickstarter projects for writers I had seen once has now launched as a stand-alone offer. It’s called <a title="Freewrite" href="https://getfreewrite.com">Freewrite</a> and, as its creators claim, it’s <em>world’s first smart typewriter</em>. What is Freewrite and how can it help you unleash your creativity while writing next bestselling novel? Let’s find out.</p>

          <a class="post-link" href="/skins-summer-holiday-review/">
            Skins Summer Holiday - a review
          </a>
        </h3><p>A week ago I eventually had an opportunity to read, for the first time, second Skins novel called <em>Summer Holiday</em>. Despite not that original title the novel was supposed to revealed some unknown (yet anticipated) details about characters of the third generation of “the E4 cult TV series”, as claims cover description. I like Skins, and I like third generation in particular, so I decided to give <em>Skins Summer Holiday</em> a chance to convince me if it’s as good as the series itself, or at least, not much worse.</p>

        </h3><p>As most of you probably know, I’m a zealous fan of Twitter as it has been my first (and the only, after deleting Facebook account permanently in Summer 2014) social network. I’ve been using it productively for years and always happy with native Twitter app for mobile and its website on my computers. The day had finally come when I abandoned Twitter’s own app and moved on to a third party software, Tweetbot.</p>

        </h3><p>There might be a point in your life when instead of typing an e-mail you would prefer to use older and more sophisticated form of correspondence, like a traditional handwritten letter. And what would be a better decoration of such a letter than a wax seal?</p>

        </h3><p>When you are in your mid-twenties, there aren’t many things you can do for the first time in your life (except of getting a mortgage loan, perhaps). Usually you already have pretty vast experience of various situations, people and emotions and maybe even start to think (with arrogance typical for fairly young people) that nothing is able to surprise you or extract from you feelings you haven’t felt so far. In the end twenty-few years should be enough to get to know yourself in almost every possible way, shouldn’t it? Well, it’s just rubbish.</p>
