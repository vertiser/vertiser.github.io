    <p>If you are a gamer, you probably have a long list of titles in your library, and chances are, you have not played all of those games. Thanks to spontaneous purchases, Steam Summer Sales, Black Friday offers, etc. we tend to accumulate more and more games at attractive prices. ‘It was a bargain, and I wanted to play this game anyway’ one may justify their purchase to themselves (<em>I</em> do quite often, actually). In the end many of those games never see the proverbial light of day, and they stay on shelves of our digital libraries, collecting virtual dust. <!--more--></p>

<p>During my decades of gaming I realised that, most of the time, I prefer to replay known titles rather than to try out something new. I have certain favourites that have a permanent place in my heart, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_(video_game)">Gothic</a>, Skyrim, The Witcher series, and I like to get back to them whenever I can. But the problem arising from this attitude is, I rarely try something new. Buying Nintendo Switch in 2019 has partially alleviated the issue, allowing me to try many new games, especially when travelling. But it has not solved the problem with many titles staying in my library, never even installed, or only opened briefly for a couple of minutes. At some point I decided to change that, so I created the <a href="../all-games/">All Games</a> project.</p>

<p><strong><a href="../all-games/">The All Games</a> project is my attempt at playing every single game I have in my gaming library (or <em>all</em> my gaming libraries, to be precise).</strong> I have an intention to play every game on my many accounts: Steam, GOG, Origin, as well as standalone games I bought digitally or physically over the years. The goal is, to actually experience all the games I own. So I do not want to only open them, finish the first chapter, mission or quest and be done with it, but get involved with the core aspect of each game. This rule does not specify that I must have a 100% completion of all games<sup id="fnref:fn1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fn1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, nor that I need to get all of the game’s achievements/trophies on a respective platform. I do not need to finish the main storyline or quest, but I must engage in each game. For certain games I may add my own goals or achievements that I want to get. Once I obtain them all, I will consider game fully completed from my point of view.</p>

<p>Should I inevitably buy some new games along the way, they will be added to the goal; they will affect the progression and count towards the total number of games to play. Both the list of the games and the progression will be updated regularly. Naturally, games that I had already played and completed will be included in the list. I have no incentive to do things that I do not like in my free time, so if there is a game that displeasures me, I will abandon it at certain point, but not before making several attempts to discover some likeable aspects.</p>

<p>There is no specific timeframe or a deadline for the whole endeavour. I treat it as an ongoing personal project, a way of making sure I fully utilise the entertainment potential of games I already own. <a href="../all-games/">The progress page</a> will be updated regularly, to reflect the current status of the project.</p>

    <li id="fn:fn1" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>as a matter of fact, it would be impossible, since many games do not have a measurable progress or completion <a href="#fnref:fn1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
